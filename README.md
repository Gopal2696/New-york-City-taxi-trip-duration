# New-york-city-taxi-trip-duration
This was a competiton project that I made thhrough Kaggle.
This project uses Machine learning algorthims to predict how much time a particular trip is going to last.
I have made this using Google Colab and Jupyter Notebook.
Tools used:- Python, Numpy , Pandas, Matplotlib, Machine learning algorithim like XGboost.
I am also going to implement the problem using tensor flow.
